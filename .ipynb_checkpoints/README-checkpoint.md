# Indonesian Dependency Parser and NER SpaCy Model
Welcome to this repository research project, this project is a project for my final essay at Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta. This project only cover the Dep. Parser and NER on the pipeline, notice that POS Tagging is also there because of the dataset. But this repo only focus on building the Dep. Parser and NER using SpaCy algorithms.

## Datasets
In this project I use third party datasets for building the model:
- Dependency Parser used Indonesian GSD dataset from [Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/#download)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) used NER dataset from [BahasaID](https://alert.id/bahasaid/)
